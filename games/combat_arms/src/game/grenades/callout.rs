//! The throw call-out (specs/combat_arms/grenades.md, Corrections
//! (2026-10-27) C1; effects_sounds.md 11): the voice that calls a grenade
//! out, not a weapon sound.
//!
//! When the server makes a grenade from a fire message (`grenades::launch`;
//! not a death's release) and the weapon calls out (`GrenadeParams::
//! call_out`: `PlayAutoThrowSound` on and `Guntype` 7), it sends the
//! thrower's team `CaThrowCallout` (the auto-cast record
//! `GrenadeThrowing`: outer radius 500, files `EventSounds::grenade_*` by
//! the thrower's voice, one of two at random). `send` gives it to the
//! readers on the thrower's team, the thrower included (`chat::readers`,
//! as the music triggers do: this machine's player directly, a remote
//! player as a server message); other teams never get it. `hear` plays it
//! on a client: 3D at the thrower (with the thrower as its source), volume
//! 100, the default volume class, and dropped while the client's previous
//! call-out still plays (`CalloutLimiter`).
//!
//! Known shortcuts: the sound is placed at the thrower when it starts and
//! does not follow them as they move (Chimera's one-shots fix their gain
//! at the start: `effects::sounds`); the voice is the body's skeleton's
//! (0 male, 1 female), the male VIP's template is not told apart.
