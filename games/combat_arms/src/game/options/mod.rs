//! Combat Arms' options (specs/combat_arms/options.md): the settings the
//! options screen edits and the profile file that keeps them, with no
//! drawing: the front end (`ui::options`) is the screen on top of this
//! and hands the results to the shell (mouse look, mixer, brightness).
//!
//! - `settings`: every option as data (`Setting`: console variable,
//!   profile section and key, type, code default, page, when it applies),
//!   the console variables registered from it and `CaSettings`, their
//!   values;
//! - `flow`: the profile's life (F: loading with the template and the
//!   version rule, K4's bindings, saving) and the screen's (P: opening,
//!   OK, Cancel, Default per tab, previews, key capture, the quality
//!   preset's apply);
//! - `bindings` (K, with `keys`): the 42 bindable actions, a binding's
//!   three slots, the missing-binding rules, rebinding by capture, the
//!   console's binds;
//! - `mouse` (M), `slider` (W), `video` (G: gamma, modes, presets, the
//!   Custom switches), `sound` (S2), `social` (O: the Other tab, the
//!   block list);
//! - `derive`: what the settings mean for the game (`CaMouseLook`,
//!   `CaSoundLevels`, `CaGamma`, `CaGameOptions`), the in-match sensitivity
//!   keys with their chat line, the HUD on/off key and the help key.
//!
//! The profile is `options.profile` (`chimera_core::profile`): the text of
//! `Profiles/player.txt` in the player's folder, created from the
//! template (`data/options/default_profile.prf`, ours) when missing and
//! kept unchanged where the options don't manage a line. The
//! options' console variables are the live values; the screen's edits wait
//! (`CaOptions::pending`) for OK unless the setting applies at once (a
//! preview that Cancel undoes).
//!
//! Known shortcuts (docs/tech-debt.md; the spec's most literal reading):
//! - The default profile is ours: the spec could not read the game's
//!   template (Open questions 1 and 2), so its values (volumes 70 and 50,
//!   sensitivity 5, gamma 1.22, High quality) are chosen, the stock keys
//!   are the spec's.
//! - The profile is in the user's data folder (beside the console's
//!   config), not the game's folder, and plain text; the Steam build's
//!   encryption (Open question 1) isn't there.
//! - There is no lobby, so the screen opens by the `options` console
//!   command (any time no match is running).
//! - Resolution, depth, anti-aliasing, window mode, vsync, quality
//!   presets and the Custom block are stored, derived (`Derived`) and
//!   kept; the renderer applies none of them, only brightness (a ramp)
//!   and the sound and mouse settings reach the shell. The music list's
//!   choices and the voice devices have no backing.
//! - Joystick bindings are kept and shown, never read; some actions'
//!   features aren't built (`bindings::COMMANDS_UNBUILT`).
//! - Binds are applied to the console's binds at load and OK; the
//!   console's own `bind` doesn't write the profile.
//! - Gamma maps to the shell's `mat_monitorgamma` (2.2 / gamma), which
//!   the shell clamps to 1.6..2.6, so only gamma 0.85 to 1.375 shows.
