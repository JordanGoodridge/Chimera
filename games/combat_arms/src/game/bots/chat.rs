//! Bot chat (specs/combat_arms/bots.md 10, Open question 23): on its
//! events a bot may say a line of its chat set. The server checks the
//! bot's cooldown (its profile's `NextChatTime`, 10 s when it has none:
//! `cooldown`); if it has passed it restarts it **before** the roll, then shows a line with probability by
//! the event's percent: the milliseconds since start mod 100 at most the
//! percent (`math::chat_roll`). The line is the string-table key
//! `$Message<set>_<Event>_<0..9>` (the set, 0-2, drawn once per bot), shown
//! in the chat box for 10 s as "nickname : line" (`CaBotChat`; the front
//! end resolves the key through the game's string table, `shown_line`:
//! our own text for a key the table lacks).
//!
//! The events: a kill of a **player** by the bot (never of another AI), its
//! death and its respawn; from the brain (`CaBot::chat`) the start of its
//! attack from another state (battle), of its patrol goal, spawns
//! included (search), and of a grenade dodge that found a point (grenade).
//!
//! Known shortcuts: the mine event (its sight sense firing on a placed
//! device) is never raised, the game has no placed devices as targets; the
//! install's profile file isn't read, so every profile has the default
//! cooldown unless `data/bots.toml` names one (Open question 26); the line
//! isn't sent to network clients.
