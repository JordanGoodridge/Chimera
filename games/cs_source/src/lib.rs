//! Counter-Strike: Source as a game crate (docs/ARCHITECTURE.md,
//! "Crates"): its simulation on the engine's crates and, with the `ui`
//! feature, its front end (`ui`: the GameUI menus and dialogs, the join
//! flow, the buy, team, radio and spectator menus, the scoreboard and
//! CS:S's HUD, on the client shell, `chimera_client`). `game` is the
//! game's parts: its loaders (BSP, materials, models,
//! sounds, the install's search path), Source movement, the weapons and
//! grenades, impacts and effects, animation and `CsSourcePlugins`;
//! `rules` (deathmatch, team joining, rounds, the end of a game) and
//! `objectives` (bomb, hostages, zones) are CS:S's rules, which its rule
//! modules (`game::rules`) describe; `bot` is CS:S's bots (aim,
//! navigation, team plans, radio, buying, grenades, the bomb and
//! hostage goals); `game::net` is its part of the network (its round, bomb
//! and hostages replicated, its join flow, bots and holds behind the
//! network's hooks). It uses the engine crates
//! (`chimera_core`, `chimera_world`, `chimera_sim`, `chimera_net`),
//! Source's map logic (`source_logic`) and `source_formats`, never
//! `mashup` or another game (checked); only `ui` uses the presentation
//! and the shell (optional dependencies of the feature, checked), so a
//! dedicated server builds and runs the game without drawing and nothing
//! but `ui` uses `ui`.
//!
//! `SimPlugins`: everything CS:S's simulation needs but its parts (the
//! engine's base, Source's map logic, CS:S's rules, objectives, bots and
//! network part; `game::CsSourcePlugins` adds the parts after it), what
//! the app runs; `swap_map`: a map in place of the one playing, as the
//! game's `map` does without the view (the dedicated server's
//! `changelevel`, tests); `harness`: CS:S on the engine's headless
//! harness (`harness::CsSim`, the base of its scenario tests, tests/it/
//! and tests/ui/; maps for network tests).
//!
//! The game crate re-exports `game` as `mashup::games::cs_source` with
//! `ui` beside it (with `present`), and `rules`, `objectives` and `bot` at
//! their old paths (`mashup::rules`, ...).
