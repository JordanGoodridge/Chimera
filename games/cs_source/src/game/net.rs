//! CS:S's rules over the network (docs/plans/active/multiplayer.md, slice
//! 5): the game's part of the network (`net::NetAppExt::net_part`,
//! registered by `CsSourceNetPlugin`), registered after the engine's own
//! protocol. Everything here is the server's, and a client shows it.
//!
//! - **The round** (`NetRound`, one replicated entity): phase, its times,
//!   the score, whether buying is open, the bomb's outcome and the
//!   hostages' tally. A client writes them into the same resources single
//!   player has (`rules::rounds::RoundState`, `weapon::economy::BuyWindow`,
//!   `objectives::bomb::BombState`, `HostageTally`), times moved onto its
//!   own clock (`net::game::ServerTime`), so the HUD, the scoreboard and
//!   the spectator bars read them as they always did. A round's end comes
//!   as `RoundOver` (the banner and the announcer).
//! - **Requests**: joining a team (`TeamRequest`) or a class
//!   (`ClassRequest`) is the server's to check (`mp_limitteams`); a
//!   refusal comes back as `net::Notice`, the game's hint.
//! - **Objectives**: the planted bomb (`NetBomb`: where, its timer, who
//!   defuses), hostages as characters (`NetHostage`), what happens as
//!   `ObjectiveNews` (the HUD's words); a player's automatic hints
//!   (`rules::hints`) to its client as `HintNews`.
//! - **Hooks** the network calls (`net::parts`): the join flow
//!   (`net::JoinRules`: `rules::JoinChoice`, `hold_out`,
//!   `make_unassigned`, `join_spectators`, `enter_game`), bots
//!   (`net::BotHooks`: `bot::kick_bot` with the quota one lower,
//!   `bot::sync_quota`), the holds a client predicts (`net::Holds`: the
//!   freeze's end, `rules::rounds::frozen_intent`; arming and defusing,
//!   `objectives::bomb::BombHold`, before `net::predict::RecordCommand`),
//!   and what goes when serving stops (`net::NetHooks`: the round's
//!   entity, `NetBomb`, `NetHostage`).
//! - **Voice** (`net::voice::VoiceRules::can_hear`): who hears whom,
//!   `hears_voice`: `sv_alltalk 1` everyone; 0 (CS:S's default) the
//!   team, a dead talker only by the dead (spectators a team of their
//!   own).
//!
//! Known shortcuts (docs/tech-debt.md): Voice's hearing rule
//! (`game::net::hears_voice`): `sv_alltalk`'s default and help are measured
//! (probe server), the dead-talk-to-the-dead rule is CS:S's documented
//! behaviour, unconfirmed with two clients; unassigned players are a team of
//! their own (ours).
//!
//! Scores, buying and the rules' sounds are every game's (`net::game`).
