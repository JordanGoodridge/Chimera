//! `cs_source`'s integration tests of its front end (feature `ui`), as one
//! test binary (each file a module): menus and HUD logic on the client
//! shell, checks that need the presentation, and the scenario tests that
//! use the shell's or the front end's state (on the headless harness with
//! CS:S's base, `harness::CsSim`, as tests/it/'s). `cargo test -p
//! cs_source --features dev,ui --test ui`. Where tests go:
//! docs/OBSERVABILITY.md, section 1.
//!
//! `stack` (tests/common/stack.rs) re-exports what the scenario tests run
//! on at the CS:S app's paths, `client` among them.
//!
//! `heavy` holds the slow ones (real maps from the install): the fast
//! tier skips them with `-- --skip heavy::`.
