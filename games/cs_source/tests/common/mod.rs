//! What both of `cs_source`'s test binaries share (`mod common;` in
//! tests/it/main.rs and tests/ui/main.rs; a change here runs all of the
//! crate's tests, `repo_checks`' `affected`).
//!
//! `load_map`: a CS:S map by id from the user's install, as the CS:S app
//! loads it (`cs_source_app::games::load_map_level`, which tests here
//! can't use: the app sits above this crate); `load_map_file` from a
//! downloaded copy and `map_file_bytes` (the file the network offers and
//! hashes), as the app's `games` has them. `stack.rs`: what the scenario
//! tests run on, at the app's paths.
