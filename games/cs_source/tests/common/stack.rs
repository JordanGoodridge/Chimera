//! What the scenario tests run on, at the paths the CS:S app re-exports it
//! (`cs_source_app::core`, `::map`, `::harness`, ...: where these tests
//! lived until 2026-10-15), so a test reads the same here as there:
//! Chimera's crates, Source's logic, CS:S's simulation (and with `ui` its
//! front end and the client shell), the harness with CS:S's base
//! (`harness::CsSim`), the greybox, and maps from the install
//! (`games::load_map`, tests/common/mod.rs). `mod stack;` in a binary's
//! main.rs; `use crate::stack::{core::Intent, harness::{CsSim, Sim}};`.
//!
//! Only re-exports: anything a test needs that isn't here belongs in its
//! crate, not in this file.
