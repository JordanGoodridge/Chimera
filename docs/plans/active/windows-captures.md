# Captures on the Windows PC (CS:S client)

What's left of [parity-gaps.md](parity-gaps.md) "Captures wanted" needs the
real CS:S client: screenshots, the client's own sounds, a human player.
Everything server-side is measured already (probe server, SourceTV demos).
This is a checklist for one or two sittings; each item names its capture
in parity-gaps.md, where the full description is.

Keep the files out of the repo (they are game output): put them in one
folder, e.g. `Documents\lp-captures\<date>\`, and send the folder (or a zip)
to the coordinator session. Name each file after its item (`C7_bomb_1s.png`).

Setup once: CS:S, windowed 1280x720 (`-windowed -w 1280 -h 720`), default
settings otherwise. Console on (`con_enable 1`). Screenshots with `jpeg` or
F5 land in `cstrike\screenshots\`.

## Sitting 1: a listen server with bots (about 45 min)

Create Server, de_dust2, 10 bots, `sv_cheats 1`, `mp_roundtime 2`.

1. **A POV demo for `demosim`** (most useful single item): `cl_cmdrate 66;
   cl_updaterate 66; record pov1`, play two rounds normally (walk, run, jump,
   crouch, shoot every gun you can, throw grenades), then `stop`. The file is
   `cstrike\pov1.dem`. A second one on a surf or bhop map if you play those.
2. **C7 round win panel** and **C12 win panel contents**: screenshots 1 s and
   4 s after each round end (elimination, bomb, defuse, time), with the
   scoreboard (Tab) once per round.
3. **C8 damage indicator**: `bot_stop 1`, get shot from left, right, front,
   behind (`setang` to turn); screenshots 0.1, 0.5 and 1 s after each hit.
4. **C3 weapon selection sounds**: record the game's audio (OBS or similar)
   with `hud_fastswitch 0`: press 2, 2 again, 4 with no grenade, the wheel
   twice, then attack; the same with `hud_fastswitch 1`.
5. **C4 autobuy and rebuy**: as described in parity-gaps.md C4, plus the
   console text each prints (copy the console or screenshot it).
6. **C11 team balance**: `mp_autoteambalance 1; mp_limitteams 0`, put four
   bots on T and yourself plus one bot on CT, play a round: who moves, the
   message, when.
7. **C15 muzzle flash**: in the lower tunnel, `host_timescale 0.1`,
   screenshots of the first two frames of an AK-47, USP, M3 and AWP shot.
8. **C23 sprays** and **C24 night vision**: as in parity-gaps.md.
9. **Empty gun with no reserve**: empty a pistol's last clip with no spare
   ammo (`give weapon_deagle`, fire everything, then drop to 0 reserve
   with `buy` disabled or after the buy time): does CS:S switch to another
   weapon by itself after the last shot, or stay on the empty gun
   clicking? The probe bot switched to its knife, but that may be its AI;
   ours stays on the empty gun.
10. **C25 votes** (needs a second human player on the listen server):
   `callvote` alone, a kick vote and a changelevel vote, F1 during a
   vote, a refused call; screenshots of each panel, as in parity-gaps.md
   C25.
11. **C26 automatic hints**: on a fresh profile with `cl_autohelp 1`
    (rename `cfg\config.cfg` first, put it back after), which hints
    appear when, as described in parity-gaps.md C26 (a video of the
    first two rounds is easiest; note each hint's time).
12. **C29 client props**: on cs_italy, knife and shoot a small cardboard
    box and a mug or bottle (count the hits each takes), with the game's
    audio recorded (any sound when a bottle breaks, beyond the bullet's?);
    on de_inferno, shoot a window (break sound or none?); then break a
    bottle and `mp_restartgame 1` (is it back?). As in parity-gaps.md
    C29.
13. **C30 refused hits**: with `mp_friendlyfire 0`, shoot and knife a
    teammate bot (audio recorded, screenshots 0.1 s after: blood, a
    flesh impact?); then `god` with kevlar and get shot by an enemy bot
    (armour on the HUD, sounds, flinch, slowdown, blood). As in
    parity-gaps.md C30.
14. **C31 HE ear-ringing**: with `mp_friendlyfire 0`, a teammate bot's
    HE at your feet (audio recorded, `dsp_player` in the console right
    after); again in `noclip`; once with `mp_friendlyfire 1`. As in
    parity-gaps.md C31.
15. **C32 planting the bomb**: a screen recording (or screenshots every
    0.25 s) of a plant on de_dust2 A, first person, from the press to the
    bomb on the ground, with `cl_c4progressbar 1` and again with 0; then a
    defuse with each; then a bot planting seen from beside it. As in
    parity-gaps.md C32.

## Sitting 2: sound (about 20 min)

Record the game's audio (OBS, 48 kHz) for:

1. **C5 under water**: in de_nuke's deep water (de_aztec's river is too
   shallow to go under), head under, a bot firing an AK-47 at about 500
   units; then the same with the head above.
2. **The planted bomb's beeps** (objectives.md Q4: the server sends none,
   the client makes them): plant on de_dust2 B (`mp_c4timer 45`), stand
   next to it and record until the explosion; the beep times give the
   schedule.
3. **Sound distance falloff** (parity-gaps "Distance falloff curves", the
   last high-impact gap): `bot_stop 1`, a bot firing an AK-47 from 250, 500,
   1000, 2000 and 3000 units in a straight open line (de_dust2 long A), you
   standing still facing it; say the distance into the mic or note the times.

## Sitting 3: refcmp references (automatic, about 30 min)

`scripts\playtest.ps1` builds the game; refcmp drives CS:S by itself
(docs/OBSERVABILITY.md, refcmp). Run the capture modes listed in C10, C17,
C18, C19, C20, C21, C22 and C27 (each names its views and settings). The output
folder is printed at the end: send it.

## Sitting 4: the other stock maps (mostly automatic, about 40 min)

Reference views exist only for de_dust2, de_aztec, cs_office and de_nuke;
the other stock maps (docs/plans/active/other-maps.md) were checked by
eye only. refcmp drives CS:S by itself, as in sitting 3:

1. `refcmp capture-ref --views tools/refcmp/<map>.toml` for de_train,
   de_inferno, de_dust, cs_assault, cs_compound, de_cbble, de_chateau,
   de_prodigy and de_tides (views from their cameras, spawns and
   bomb/rescue zones). Send the `refcmp/<map>/ref/` folders.
2. cs_italy, de_port, cs_havana and de_piranesi have no
   `point_viewcontrol` for refcmp to move, so take their views by hand:
   `sv_cheats 1; noclip; cl_drawhud 0; r_drawviewmodel 0`, then for each
   `[[view]]` in `tools/refcmp/<map>.toml` `setpos x y z-64` (the file
   holds eye positions, setpos the feet) and `setang pitch yaw 0`, wait a
   second, `jpeg refcmp_<name> 95`.
3. **cs_compound's fog colour by view direction** (its
   `env_fog_controller` blends two colours, `fogblend 1`: warm yellow
   toward yaw 108, grey away; ours draws the first only): from the CT
   spawn, `setang 0 108 0` and `setang 0 288 0`, a screenshot each of the
   far skyline. Says whether the blend shows at all at its distances
   (fog from 3000 units) and which colour lies which way.
4. **de_prodigy's vent fans** (`fan.mdl` lit from an
   `info_lighting_relative`, which ours ignores): `setpos 2384 -1511 -24;
   setang 89 0 0` (looking down at the fan from 116 units above), a
   screenshot: are the blades lit like the vent around them, or darker?

## Sitting 5: Combat Arms (a room with a friend or bots, about 40 min)

Live checks the Wave 1 specs could not settle from the reference (each
names its spec and open question in `specs/combat_arms/`). Combat Arms'
own client, any map unless named; a screen recording of each is easiest.

1. **Scale** (movement.md Q3): stand next to a standard door or crate of
   known real size; note its height against the eye (83 units) from a
   screenshot side on. Says whether bodies or the HUD's 40 units a metre
   are to scale.
2. **Teleporters** (movement.md Q16): on a map with a teleporter, use
   one that drops you a long way: any fall damage on landing?
3. **Second victim** (weapon_firing.md Q5): two players or bots standing
   in line, one M4A1 round at the first's chest from about 2800 units:
   does the second take damage (about 17 if unarmoured)?
4. **Turn and spread** (weapon_firing.md Q13): stand still with the M4A1,
   flick the mouse 30 degrees back and forth for a few seconds: does the
   crosshair ever shrink faster than standing still without turning?
   Then the same while strafing.
5. **Pickup box** (inventory.md Q13): drop an M16A3 on flat ground and
   aim at it from the side and from its end, moving the aim off it a
   little at a time: at which offsets from its centre does the pickup
   prompt appear and vanish (a screenshot at each edge)?
6. **Spent grenade in the list** (inventory.md Q14): throw your last
   grenade, then press 4 or another class key: is the grenade's entry in
   the weapon list greyed, hidden or shown with 0?
7. **Pickup switch** (inventory.md Q6): carry a pistol, hold the rifle,
   pick up a pistol of the same kind dropped by someone: does the pistol
   come out?
8. **Drop spot** (inventory.md Q17): stand still facing one way on flat
   ground and die (or swap weapons by picking one up), several times:
   where does the item lie relative to where you stood (a screenshot
   from above, `getpos` if the console allows)?
9. **Free-for-all teams** (hud_crosshair.md Q15): in a free-for-all room,
   hit another player: does the crosshair turn red? Do players you are
   not aiming at show name tags?
10. **Name tag height** (hud_crosshair.md Q10): a teammate on flat ground
    next to a wall mark of known height at the same distance: a
    screenshot to compare the tag's height with the mark.
11. **Server frame rate** (grenades.md Q6): drop a frag from a known
    height onto flat ground (look straight down, release): count the
    frames between bounces in a recording, or read the server's frame time
    from a packet capture. We use the shipped server's 20 Hz.
12. **Frag through a body** (grenades.md Q7): throw a frag at a standing
    teammate's chest from about 100 units: where does it land compared
    with the same throw past them (1 to 3 factors of 0.65 expected)? We
    count the character's box and its hit-box object's (taken as the hit
    spheres' bounds), each step inside.
13. **End-of-round phase** (grenades.md Q20): time from a round's result
    to the respawn in Elimination or Search & Destroy (the shipped
    configuration says 3 s); a frag thrown just before the result: does it
    hurt players after the respawn?
14. **Sky edge** (world_dat.md Q11): look at the sky over a low roof edge
    on WAREHOUSE and SNOWSTORM: a screenshot. We draw the sky world model
    over the whole screen behind the world; the game only inside the sky
    portals' screen rectangle.
15. **Fullbright texture in the dark** (world_dat.md Q13): find a surface
    whose texture has the fullbright flag (textures_dtx.md case 5's,
    TEXTURES\FLOOR\GB_CELLING_FB005.DTX, or any glowing sign) in a dark
    corner: do its bright parts stay at full brightness? We draw it lit.
16. **Group 5 textures** (textures_dtx.md Q4): an effect that shows one of
    `FX.rez`'s 28 group-5 textures at a known size (a screenshot close up):
    is it its file's level 0 or one level down? We load level 0.

## What each sitting unlocks

- Sitting 1: movement and weapon checks against real human play (demosim),
  the HUD panels' look and timing, autobuy/rebuy rules, team balance, muzzle
  flash, sprays and night vision values.
- Sitting 2: the sound falloff curve (the last high-impact parity gap) and
  the underwater muffle.
- Sitting 3: HDR, 3D skybox fog, ropes, beams, sky, LOD, detail props and
  what cs_assault's PVS hides past sky brushes.
- Sitting 4: side-by-side checks of the 13 stock maps never compared
  (refcmp `report`), cs_compound's fog blend, prodigy's fan lighting.
- Sitting 5: Combat Arms' scale, teleport falls, two-victim rounds, the
  spread's turn term, pickup boxes and drop spots, the spent grenade's
  list entry, free-for-all team ids and name tag height; the server's
  frame rate, grenades through bodies, the end-of-round phase, the sky's
  edge, fullbright textures and group-5 mip skipping.
