# Restart the box's sccache server if it has leaked jobserver tokens.
#
# sccache's server keeps its own jobserver (one token per CPU thread) and
# hands it to the rustc it runs. When a client is killed mid-build (a tool
# timeout), the server kills that rustc (kill_on_drop), and tokens the rustc
# held are gone for good. Once all are gone every later request waits forever
# at 0% CPU, which looks like a hung server. Whenever the server has no
# children, its pipe must hold every token; fewer, on two looks 3 s apart,
# means a leak and nothing real is in flight, so the server is restarted.
# Usage: tools/sccache-heal.sh   (agent-env.sh runs it when sourced)
