//! What a player's view ray points at, for any game's HUD: the eye and
//! direction a character looks along as drawn this frame (`view_ray`: the
//! eased eye with its view punch), the character a ray hits first
//! (`character_under`: the world and props block it, a collider counts
//! as the character it or a parent belongs to), and whether a straight
//! line between two points is clear (`clear_line`). Target IDs and name
//! tags use it (CS:S's `ui::target_id`, Combat Arms' `ui::hud`); each
//! game keeps its own range, words and look.
