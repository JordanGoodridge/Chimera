//! What a bullet does that every game shares, whoever's gun fired it on
//! whoever's map (docs/DESIGN.md, "Impacts across games"):
//!
//! - **Who draws an impact** (`ImpactRoute`): each game whose effects draw
//!   impacts registers as a provider (`ImpactAppExt::register_impact_provider`);
//!   an impact is drawn by the gun's game when it is a provider and its
//!   looks are on the map (`map::impact::ActiveImpacts`), else by the map's
//!   game on the same terms, else by any provider whose looks the map
//!   carries (an app's gameplay on another game's map), else by Chimera's
//!   generic impact (`ImpactBy::
//!   Generic`, the client's `effects::GenericImpactsPlugin`). Every game's
//!   impact systems ask the route and draw only their own, so one impact
//!   is drawn once. The hit surface goes between the games by class
//!   (`map::impact::SurfaceClasses`).
//! - **The push on physics objects** (`BulletImpulse`): every game's
//!   bullets tell the impulse they give a body at the hit point, in N·s
//!   (each game converts its own numbers: CS:S's damage force by ammo
//!   type from its weapon data's `impulse`, Combat Arms' from its damage,
//!   `combat_arms::game::weapons::IMPULSE_PER_HIT_POINT`), and
//!   `apply_bullet_impulses` gives it to dynamic bodies, times
//!   `phys_pushscale` (`PushScale`), after the weapon frame in the
//!   predicted weapon tick (`ApplyImpulses`: a game telling pushes after
//!   the frame orders itself before it). The server's
//!   alone: a client's own shots push nothing.
//! - **Spawn protection hides hits** (`core::SpawnProtected`): a hit on
//!   a protected character shows nothing on any machine, whichever game's
//!   gun or effects: Chimera's deliveries tell its trace with no `hit`
//!   (`deliver`), and a game with its own (Combat Arms') passes its
//!   events through `hide_protected`; so no game draws blood, a puff, a
//!   decal or an impact sound there, nor a hit indicator or name-tag
//!   flash (those follow the `Hit`s and traces), and the damage the rules
//!   block (`core::God`) never shows as landed.
//! - **Whose recoil the view punch is** (`RecoilGame`): each game kicks
//!   and returns the shared `ViewPunch` by its own rules; a character
//!   that switches to another game's weapon (the gun game's swap on a
//!   kill) ends the old game's punch: the punch is zeroed and the
//!   component names the new game, whose rules alone touch it from then
//!   (each game's recoil code checks `RecoilGame::is`). Set in the
//!   predicted selection (`core::Predict::Select`), from the predicted
//!   inventory, so the server and the client predicting the player agree.
